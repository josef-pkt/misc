Wald tests are based on unrestricted parameter which additionally allows to test different hypothesis without estimating the model under different restrictions.

Estimating the restricted models can be easier when we want to compute diagnostic tests to check whether the restricted model is correct, but it requires that we estimated each restricted model separately if we test several restrictions, as in the use case for the Wald test that provides p-values and confidence intervals for each parameter. \n",

However, GMM estimates can be noisy in small samples, and we can often improve the precision of the estimates by including available information in the calculation of the weight matrix or the covariance of the moment conditions. In this case, we could use the assumption of normality and of no heteroscedasticity also on the updating of the weight matrix (see ??? for an empirical example.) However, tests for variance that are derived under normality are in general very sensitive to deviations from normality, and we are trading of increased precision to robustness to misspecification. One example for this is the Bartlett test for the equality of variances. If we want to test the null hypothesis of normality, then imposing normality on the weight matrix would be in the spirit of score or Lagrange multiplier tests, where we want to derive our test statistic under the null. To emphasize again, these versions of test for overidentifying restrictions and LM tests are asymptotically equivalent but will differ in small sample properties.\n",
