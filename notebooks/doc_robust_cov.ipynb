    "# Why? Some theoretical background\n",
    "\n",
    "The ususal standard errors for parameter estimates are derived under the assumption that the observations are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) or that estimates are based on a correctly specified likelihood function. This will often not be the case with actual data or with estimators other than maximum likelihood (MLE).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest case is estimating with OLS when the errors are either heteroscedastic, i.e. the variance variies with the explanatory variables, or are correlated across observations, either within a cluster or autocorrelated. OLS provides a consistent estimator for the mean parameters but the standard errors for the parameters will be wrong if either heteroscedasticity or correlation is present. One solution is to use a model that explicitly takes the violation of i.i.d. into account which, however, assumes that we know what the variance function or correlation structure is. The alternative is to correct the standard errors by using an estimator for the covariance of the parameter estimates that is robust to those deviations. Specifically, we can use estimators that are robust to unspecified heteroscedasticity (HC), heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation (HAC) or to correlation of observations within a group of observations (cluster).\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimator parameters provided by OLS is also maximum likelihood estimate under the assumption of normal distributed errors and, consequently, response. However, OLS does not assume a specific distribution to obtain consistent estimates of the mean parameters. We only need that the mean function, i.e. the linear model in this case, is correctly specified. The same property extends to all distributions that are in the linear exponential family, which includes the distribution in GLM and several distribution in discrete models, for example Probit, Logit and Poisson.\n",
    "As a consequence we can also in those models consistently estimate the mean parameters even if correlation and variance function are misspecified. However, as in the case of OLS, the usual covariance parameter is not correct with these deviation and we can use robust covariance matrices to get asymptotically correct standard errors for our parameter estimates. This case is usually refered to as Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimation (QMLE).\n",
    "Note: The term QMLE is often used in a generic way, but also refers to some specific approaches. Specifically, we will not consider the quasi likelihood as defined by ..., we will mainly focus on the estimating equations or moment conditions. This means that we are maximizing a likelihood function that only depends on the first two moments in the case of distributions in the LEF, and only the first moment, i.e. the mean function, needs to be correctly specified to obtain consistent estimators for its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The textbooks by Wooldridge and by Cameron and Trivedi provide a good introduction to QMLE from an econometrics perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second case of using sandwich covariance matrices is when we use an estimator that does not maximize a likelihood or quasi-likelihood such as M-estimators or Generalized Method of Moments, GMM, and Generalized Estimating Equations, GEE. In these case the asymptotic covariance of the parameter estimates has the sandwich form. In MLE the sandwich form reduces to the simple standard form because of the information matrix equality which implies that the inner and outer parts of the sandwich are asymptotically the same, or have the same expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statsmodels has currently M-estimators, in RLM and QuantileRegression, and moment estimators in GMM and GEE that have special forms of sandwich covariance matrices. GMM and GEE are general estimation procedures that can also reproduce MLE and QMLE estimators with simplified covariance matrices. MLE is also a special case of an M-estimator.\n",

    "## Which? An overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we briefly describe the types of robust covariances that are implemented in statsmodels. I will follow a general definition for the description that is based on the moment conditions implied by an estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of moment conditions, score function or estimating equations $m(\\theta)$ and a matrix of derivatives of the moment conditions or Hessian $H(\\theta)$, the sandwich covariance has the general form\n",
    "\n",
    "$H^{-1} E(m m') H^{-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the inner part $V = E(m m')$ is the covariance of the moment conditions across all observations with elements $E(m_i m_j')$ for observations i and j. $m_i m_j'$ is the outer product. If all observations are independent, then $E(m_i m_j') = 0$ for $i \\!= j$ which rules out correlation but still allows for unequal variances, i.e. heteroscedasticity. If all moment conditions are i.i.d., then this reduces to a variance or scale that is common to all observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific we can consider the linear model estimate with OLS:\n",
    "\n",
    "The moment conditions are $m_i = u_i x_i$ where $u_i = y_i - x \\beta$ are the residuals and x are exogenous explanatory variables. The derivative of the moment condition with respect to the mean parameters $beta$ for observation i is the outer product $H_i = x_i x_i'$. This also corresponds to the score and hessian functions for the normal linear model after dropping the scale or error variance which is a multiplicative factor. The variance of the moment condition between observations i and j becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(m_i m_j') = E(x_i u_i u_j x_j')$\n",
    "\n",
    "If all observations are uncorrelated then we only have terms $E(x_i u_i u_i x_i')$, if all errors have the same variance, then this becomes the standard OLS covariance $\\sigma_i * E(x_i x_i')$. In the estimator for the covariance the expectation are replaced by sums, so for the latter case we get the usual OLS inverse covariance matrix $\\sigma_i * X'X$. The derivative of the OLS moment condition is also $X' X$ so we obtain the covariance matrix under i.i.d. assumption as\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma_i (X' X)^{-1} (X' X) (X' X)^{-1} = \\sigma_i (X' X)^{-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we use the following shorthand notation $M = Xu$ refers to the vector of moment conditions by observation, which has rows corresponding to the number of observations and columns corresponding to the number of moment conditions. Furthermore to save on notation, we use the same notation for true or expected values and for the estimator, $H$ then refers to the empirical Hessian or derivative of the moment condition summed over observations. All statistics are evaluated at the given parameter estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heteroscedasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "This estimator assumes independent or uncorrelated observations, but allows for variance that varies with explanatory variables in an unspecified way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because all cross terms are zero, the covariance of the moment condition becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$V = M' M$ in the general and $V = Xu ' Xu$ in the OLS case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance matrix of the parameter usually referred to as \"HC\" or \"HC0\" estimate is \n",
    "\n",
    "$H^{-1} (M' M) H^{-1}$ or $(X' X)^{-1} (M' M) (X' X)^{-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This estimator can be strongly biased in small samples and various bias or small sample corrections have been proposed, those are abbreviated with \"HC1\", \"HC2\" and \"HC3\". Those 4 estimators are available for the linear model. There are further variations like \"HC4\" that are not available. Other models only have a single \"HC\" estimator with optional small sample correction corresponding roughly to \"HC1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "(TODO details are in documentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases the model already includes a varying variance, for example a specified heteroscedasticity in WLS or the inherent variance function in GLM/LEF models like Poisson where the variance is a function of the mean. In these cases an \"HC\" robust covariance matrix protects against left-over or misspecified heteroscedasticity. That mean that we obtain asymptotically correct standard errors for the mean parameter estimates even if the included variance function is not the true variance function. An application for this is overdispersion in Poisson, where the amount of overdispersion could vary with the covariates.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cluster correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we have data that is grouped or clustered wher observations are correlated within a group or cluster but independent across clusters. Examples for this are when we observe individuals that are from the same family or location, or panel or longitudinal data with correlation across observations for the same individual but no correlation across individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case $E(x_i u_i u_j x_j')$ is zero if the i and j are in different groups, i.e $g(i) != g(j)$ where $g(i)$ is the group indicator for observation $i$, and possibly nonzero otherwise. The estimate variance of the moment conditions aggregates over clusters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$V = M_g' M_g$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $m_g = \\sum_{i:g(i)=g} x_i u_i$ and $M_g$ is the array of all $m_g$\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar approach can be used if there are two or more cluster variables. statsmodels provides the robust covariance for one or two cluster variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties of this estimator are derived under the assumption that the number of clusters becomes large and the number of observation within clusters stays constant. If the number of clusters is small, then the estimator of the standard errors can be strongly biased. In this case a small sample correction based on the number of clusters is recommended, which is also the default in statsmodels (and in Stata).\n",

However, the usual OLS estimator for the standard errors will underestimate the true values if we ignore autocorrelation. \n",

    "Trying to apply the same aggregation as in the cluster case might not provide a positive definite and consistent (?check) estimate of the covariance matrix. Newey and West showed that a consistent covariance matrix can be obtained by aggregating kernel weighted observations. The estimator for the covariance of the moment conditions is in this case\n",

    "## Panel Data correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "In cluster robust standard errors the asymptotics is for a large number of clusters for fixed number of units per group. In a second kind of panel data the number of cross sectional units stays fixed while the number of observations or time periods per unit becomes large. Many examples in finance, cross country studies or longitudinal studies follow this pattern. The observations of any unit behaves similarly to a single time series in the HAC case, but with additional contemporaneous correlation across units. This case is similar to the case with two cluster variables except that one cluster size increases in the large sample behavior. Robust standard errors combine the behavior of cluster robust standard errors for contemporaneous observations with HAC robust standard errors in the time dimension. there are two ways to sequence the aggregation along the two dimensions. The Driscoll Kraay estimator first aggregates the cross sectional dimension and applies HAC kernel aggregation on the sum of cross sectional covariances. In the second kind, we compute the HAC robust standard errors for the time series of each cross sectional unit and then aggregate over units.\n",

    "Note, the defaults, where there is overlap, are not everywhere the same as in Stata.\n",
    "Unit test are largely written against Stata for HC1, one way cluster, and HAC with OLS and against various other packages or publications for the remainder.\n",
    "\n",

Theoretical results are in general based on asymptotic normality, however in small samples t or F can provide in some cases a better approximation to the distribution of parameters and test statistics.\n",
